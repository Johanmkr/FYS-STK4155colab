The work of Nanna Bryne and Johan Mylius Kroken in the course FYS-STK4155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning in the fall of 2022.

## Project 1 **Regression analysis and resampling methods**

## Project 2 **Classification and regression**

Found [here](https://github.com/Johanmkr/FYS-STK4155colab/tree/main/project2).

## Project 3 **Winner takes all**

Due to an unfortunate head injury obtained just moments after the last commit of project 2, we joined forces with another group for the [final project](https://github.com/hkve/FYS-STK4155/tree/main/Project3).
