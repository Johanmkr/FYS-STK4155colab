# Project 1

## Plan (Wednesday 14.09)

### Questions
* How to properly visualise $\beta$? OK
* How to properly scale $z$? Why?
* How to plot `z_train`-points?
* Should we stop at polynomial degree $n=5$? (Part c))

### To do
* Speak to CM or Anna about pt. c) (show that...). **Nansen**
* Check that pt. a) is correct. **Jojo**
* Compare own OLS code to sklearn code. **Jojo**
* Write method (formula for MSE, ...) in report. **Jojo/Nansen**
* Begin with clever code structure (idea: plot.py, utils.py, main.py). **Nansen**
