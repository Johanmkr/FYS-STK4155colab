We present our final models for the Franke function and the Grand Canyon terrain. 


\subsection{Franke function}
 
After performing the OLS analysis on the Franke function, it quickly became clear that a two-dimensional polynomial of order $d=5$ was the best model, i.e. yielding the lowest MSE. This can be seen most clearly from \Fig{model_complexity_ols} and \Fig{bias_variance_ols} we compare model of both higher and lower polynomial degree. A rough by-eye estimate of the MSE in these two cases is $\mathrm{MSE}\approx 0.16$ for the test data. This is confirmed in \Fig{cross-validation_ols} and \Fig{mse_hist_ols}, where the former yield a slightly higher MSE value. 

For the ridge analysis we just assume that the polynomial degree found for OLS will yield the best result, and seek to find the optimal $\lambda$ only. One could argue that this is naive, so we should perhaps have allowed for the polynomial degree to change when performing ridge analysis. However, with $d=5$, the optimal penalty parameter is found to be $\lambda_\mathrm{min}^\mathrm{ridge} = 7.85\cdot10^{-5}$ given to two significant figures. We have from \Fig{bootstrapping_ridge} and \Fig{mse_hist_ridge} that an approximate value of the MSE found for this model is $\mathrm{MSE} \approx 0.14$ for the test data. 

for the lasso analysis we try to find a new optimal polynomial degree, which result in the maximum value of our grid $d=14$, which is not necessarily a bad model for a $N=20$ grid, since the penalty parameter drives unimportant features to zero. However, according to \Fig{cross-validation_lasso} and \Fig{bias_variance_lasso} there seem to be an optimal $\lambda\in[10^{-5}, 10^{-4}]$. However, the MSE value of $\approx 0.16$ is higher than for both ridge and OLS. On the other hand, we could perform ridge analysis using larger polynomial degree in the heatmap and larger $\lambda$ when doing cross validation and bias variance analysis. This is very computationally expensive, and since it does not seem that lasso regression yield a significantly better results (worse for the parameters we found), we discard this model. 

One could argue that ridge yield a slightly lower MSE than OLS. However, these values are highly dependant on the method by which they were found, and the $k$-number in both bootstrap and cross validation. The only sensible conclusion is thus that they yield approximately the same result. While OLS is less computationally expensive, and gives a simpler model altogether we further conclude that OLS with a polynomial degreee $d=5$ is the model that fits the data best. 

We check this and plot the prediction model alongside the scaled data points. This can be seen in \Fig{franke_final_model} and the model is indeed good.
