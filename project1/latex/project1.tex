\abstract{
We perform linear regression on two different data sets and try to fit a two dimensional polynomial onto them. The first data set is a $20\cross20$ for which we compute values using the Franke function. We try also try to add some normally distributed noise $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ onto it. All data is z-score normalised. We perform both OLS regression, ridge regression and lasso regression on the data and estimate the validity by doing (5-10)-fold cross validation and a $k=400$ bootstrap. For the OLS regression we find an optimal model with polynomial degree $d=5$, and by using the same polynomial degree for the ridge regression we also find an optimal penalty parameter $\lambda^\mathrm{ridge} = 7.58\cdot10^{-5}$. For the lasso regression we allow the model to find a new optimal polynomial degree. It finds the end degree, for a $d\cross\lambda$ grid so we cannot determine the validity of this. However, the MSE values found from lasso and ridge regression are not sufficiently smaller than that for OLS. The conclusion is thus that OLS with $d=5$ yields the best model for the Franke data. 

We repeat the analysis for the terrain data, which is a part from the Grand Canyon in the United States, and find the lasso regression to be very computationally expensive, especially for low $\lambda$, and it does not yield a significantly better result than OLS and ridge. We therefore conclude for the terrain data that we have to viable models: THe first found with OLS giving a model with $d=6$ and the second with ridge giving a model with $d=18$ and $\lambda = 1.23\cdot10^{-4}$. The OLS model is arguably favourable since it provides a simpler model of a lesser polynomial degree.
